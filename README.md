# AJ's Dev Setup

Some scrappy shell scripts to setup my developer environment. Very opinionated
about OS and shell, this expects Debian/Ubuntu base & Bash.

## To run

Download and `cd` to source and `./setup` -- may prompt for sudo or other
confirmations, hopefully JustWorksâ„¢

As a one-shot script, try something like:
```sh
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aspenjames/ajdev_init/main/run | sh -
```
